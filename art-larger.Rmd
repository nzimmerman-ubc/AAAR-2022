## Entry ID #9: The Deposition Pattern of Nebulized Fluorescent Droplets in an Idealized Mouth throat Airway
_Yueyang Cai (Nanjing Normal University); Huizhen Yang (Nanjing Normal University); Xiaole Chen (Nanjing Normal University); and Ting Ding (Nanjing Normal University)_

>We achieved the visualization of the deposition pattern of nebulized droplets in an idealized mouth-throat (MT) airway model using normal saline with fluorescence. The fluorescent droplets were generated by a vibrating mesh nebulizer install at the inlet of the MT airway model. Air and the droplets were drawn into the MT airway model by a vacuum pump at a flow rate of 60 L/min. After the test, the two-piece symmetrical model was dissembled. The figure recorded one piece of the MT model exposed under the UV light. Most droplets deposited on the rear side of the oropharynx region, i.e., the right side of the curved pipe shown in the figure, due to the inertial impact. There are also deposition occurred at the bottom of the mouth cavity, which is caused by the gravitational sedimentation of the nebulized droplets.
